# Pokémon Pokedex

This short but sweet project is a web application that allows users to explore detailed information about the first 151 Pokémon, including their stats, abilities, types, and more. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages the PokeAPI to fetch real-time data about each Pokémon.
